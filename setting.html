	<h1>Where is Grey's Anatomy located?</h1>
	<p>Grey's Anatomy is set in a hospital in Seattle.</p>
	
	<h2>The Hospital:</h2>
	<p>Many of the doctors within the show work at the same hopsital all throughout the series.</p>
	<p>Despite the hopsital being the same in the show, it has had many name changes.</p>
		<ul>
 			<li>Originally, it was called Seattle Grace Hospital</li>
			<li>It then merged with a different hopsital, and was renamed 
				again to Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital</li>
 			<li>Finally, a group of the doctors bought the hopsital and 
 				renamed it Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital, in honor of two doctors that died. </li>
 		</ul>
	
	<h3>Where the show is shot:</h3>
	<p>Even though it is set in Seattle, the show is actually shot in Los Angeles. </p>
